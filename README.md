Specification Pattern Example (Tasks)

This GitHub repository provides an example of the Specification pattern, a commonly used design pattern in software development, applied to tasks.

The Specification pattern:

Provides a way to define and manage complex task filtering criteria.
Makes your code more modular and testable for task management functionalities.
Offers flexibility for combining and reusing different filtering conditions.
The example in this repository demonstrates a simple implementation of the Specification pattern that allows filtering tasks based on various criteria.

In this repository, you will find:

Task class: A base class representing the properties of tasks (e.g., description, priority, status).
Specification interface: An interface used to filter tasks based on specific criteria.
AndSpecification and OrSpecification classes: Classes used to combine multiple specifications.
PrioritySpecification, StatusSpecification, and potentially other specification classes (e.g., CategorySpecification for categorized tasks) depending on your specific task properties. These classes are used to filter tasks by priority, status, or other relevant properties.
TaskFilter class: A class used to filter tasks based on the applied specifications.
To use the example:

Use the Task class to represent your tasks.
Use the Specification interface and its subclasses to define filtering criteria for tasks (e.g., high priority tasks, pending tasks).
Use the TaskFilter class to apply the specifications and filter your tasks.
